# node-red-nspanel Berry Scripts

here are the Berry scripts needed for this Node-Red integration to run on the NsPanel.

## autoexec.be

This is a script that
- is automatically started
- calls `lovelace.be`
- automatically sends Wifi state, time and date to the display panel
- provides some commands used by my NodeREd integration

## lovelace.be

This is just a renamed copy of the 
[`autoexec.be`](https://github.com/joBr99/nspanel-lovelace-ui/blob/main/tasmota/autoexec.be) from the 
[NsPanel Lovelace UI](https://github.com/joBr99/nspanel-lovelace-ui) project.

For details please check the GitHub repo.
